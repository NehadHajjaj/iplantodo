# iplantodo

This is a small "play" project to learn about TypeScript.

# How to use?

Firstly make sure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM (Node Package Manager). Afterwards, from the project root folder run this command

```
npm install
```

This will download and install all the dependencies. Then you should be ready to run the project in the browser.

```
npm run go
```
